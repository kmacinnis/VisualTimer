        Thanks for testing out my app!

        Please let me know about any problems you have. You can grab me in person, or if it's easier, email me at macinnis.k@gmail.com

        One known issue is that the timer does not work in the background right now.  I'm currently working on that.
        Also, in the future I will add the ability to choose an alert sound.  Let me know if you have any other feature requests.

        Thanks again!
